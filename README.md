**Sampling Techniques**

The following five sampling techniques were used in this project:

**Simple Random Sampling**: A basic sampling technique where each data point in the dataset has an equal probability of being selected in the sample.

**Stratified Sampling**: A sampling technique where the population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on a specific characteristic, and samples are taken from each stratum in proportion to the population.

**Systematic Sampling**: A sampling technique where every nth element in the population is selected for the sample, with n being a fixed interval.

**Cluster Sampling**: A sampling technique where the population is divided into clusters, and a sample of clusters is randomly selected. Then, all members of the selected clusters are included in the sample.

**Convenience Sampling**: A non-probability sampling technique where the sample is chosen based on its convenience to the researcher.
